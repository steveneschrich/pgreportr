Description: Program grants from the NIH typically involve a reporting component, to show
 the return on investment associated with the grant. This can involve number of other grants
 submitted, papers published and other outcomes. This library is one component of a strategy
 called PROGRAM, to support this reporting. REDCap data entry is paired with an R library for
 reporting purposes. This library provides standard reports using officedown, generating both
 Word and Excel output. Many helper functions exist to create flags and filter on these flags
 in order to simplify ad-hoc reporting.
