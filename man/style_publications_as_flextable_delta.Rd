\item{d}{A data frame of publications}

A flextable consisting of formatted publication entries.

\description{
A styling function for publications
}
\details{
This function does no filtering to the table, but does the work of styling the
table as a flextable. This can involve some heavy work, however, given the various
ways in which styling requires post-processing.

The flextable (and text) styles are listed by alpha, delta, to distinguish them
as we are determining the best formatting approach.
